#### Operating System

Assembly and C study project based on nanobyte_os.

## Development

This project will have two branches: *main* and *nightly*.

*main*: Every working and tested *nightly* commits will be merged here after the Initial Commit.

*nightly*: Not properly tested code as well as half-done code written on Windows.

After testing *nightly* I'll merge it into *main*.

As this is a personal study project, please don't contribute lol.
This documentation, as well as the whole repository is mostly for practicing, and only will be considered a "serious" project if I  manage to make something more unique than shown in the nanobyte_os videos (which is not very likely lmao). In that sense, this repo is similar to my other Assembly project, **hidarite**.
